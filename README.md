## Description
This is an application that lets a user know whether a triangle is Isosceles, Equilateral, Scalene or NOT a triangle at all.
The user enters the length values of the three sides of a triangle in the form provided. The form collects the inputted values and in the background does calculations and uses appropriate control flows and logical operators to determine the type of triangle.
The values are stored in an array, although this is not strictly necessary for it to work. Then it first checks if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third remaining side, in which case a triangle can be formed, otherwise the values entered cannot form a triangle.
After this it checks if two sides are exactly equal, which forms an Isosceles triangle. Otherwise it checks if all three sides are equal, which produces an Equilateral triangle. If neither of these two results comes up, then the values form a Scalene triangle which has no sides equal.
